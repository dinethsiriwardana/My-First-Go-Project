# Go Form Handling Project
This is a simple Go project for handling form submissions. The project consists of a single server with an `index.html` file for the root endpoint and a `hello`
endpoint with a hello function.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to have Go installed on your machine. Once you have Go installed, you can run the following command to start the server:

```sh
go run main.go
```


This will start the server and make it available at <i>http://localhost:8080.</i>

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the following endpoints:

 &emsp; ∙ `/`: This is the root endpoint and will display the `index.html` file. <br>
 &emsp; ∙  `/hello`: This endpoint will execute the `hello` function and return its output.
